# ⚡ CodeFlow: The Beginner's Concept Trainer

**CodeFlow** is a personal, step-by-step coding learning engine designed to help complete beginners bridge the gap between "writing code" and "understanding logic." 

Unlike traditional IDEs, CodeFlow focuses on the **Universal Concept Model**, mapping different languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, SQL) into core building blocks like Variable Creation, Loop Iteration, and the Recursion Stack.

## 🏗️ Core Philosophy: Concepts > Syntax

CodeFlow is built on the belief that coding is about mental models, not just memorizing keywords. Every part of the UI is designed to visualize a specific computer science concept:

- **Variables**: Visual "labelled boxes" that glow when updated.
- **Loops**: A cycle tracker that counts iterations and evaluates conditions.
- **Recursion**: A 3D-style vertical stack that shows memory "piling up."
- **Logic Paths**: A dynamic flowchart that highlights the path the computer takes.

## ✨ Key Features

### ⏱️ Time-Travel Scrubber
The "Time-Travel" seek bar at the bottom allows you to rewind and fast-forward through your code's execution. See exactly how your variables evolve with every step.

### 📖 Intelligent Code Explainer
A sidebar that explains every line of your code in **simplified, friendly English**. 
- *Beginner Tip:* It automatically detects common mistakes like using `=` instead of `==` in an `if` statement.

### 📚 Recursion Stack Visualizer
Stop being confused by recursion. Watch as function calls stack up visually and "dissolve" once they return a value.

### 🗄️ SQL Pipeline Simulator
Visualize SQL queries as a transformation pipeline. Watch table rows "fade out" as they fail a `WHERE` filter and see data aggregate in real-time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Framer Motion (Animations), Monaco Editor (Editor).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Socket.io (Real-time Trace), Babel Parser (JS Simulation).
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with a premium Glassmorphic aesthetic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Modepalli-Ravindra/code-flow.git
   cd code-flow
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install backend deps
   cd server
   npm install
   
   # Install frontend deps (in root)
   cd ..
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Engines**:
   ```bash
   # Start the backend (terminal 1)
   npm run server
   
   # Start the frontend (terminal 2)
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Learn!**: Open `http://localhost:5173` and start your first "Time-Travel" coding session.

## 🗺️ The Learning Path

The system is organized into **Chapter-Based Concept Modules**:
1. **Variables & State** - Storing data in memory.
2. **Conditional Logic** - Making decisions.
3. **Iteration & Loops** - Repeating tasks efficiently.
4. **Function Stacks** - Managing reusable code.
5. **Recursion** - Deep logic and self-referential calls.
6. **Data Pipelines** - Understanding SQL and table logic.
