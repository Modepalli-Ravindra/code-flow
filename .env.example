# 🌐 CodeFlow Environment Variables

# --- LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ---
# Vite automatically handles the /ws proxy to localhost:3001 in dev mode.
# You don't usually need to set VITE_WS_URL locally.

# --- PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT ---
# If your frontend is on Vercel and your backend is on Railway/Render/VPS:
# Set this to your backend's WebSocket URL (including the /ws path).
# Example: VITE_WS_URL=wss://your-backend.railway.app/ws

# VITE_WS_URL=
